# About Me
* I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in the [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), advised by Prof. [Zhenyu (James) Kong](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/kong.html). [[Curriculum Vitae](https://boshen0.github.io/files/BoCV.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OO3dy4wAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems.
* I received my B.S. of Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China(USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)  in 2017.
