# About Me
* I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in the [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), advised by Prof. [Zhenyu (James) Kong](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/kong.html). 
   * Some of my profiles are available: [[Curriculum Vitae](https://boshen0.github.io/files/BoCV.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OO3dy4wAAAAJ&hl=en)] [[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bo-Shen-22)]
* I received my B.S. of Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)  in 2017.

# Reseach Interest
***[Smart manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_manufacturing)*** promises a future of mass-producing highly personalized products via responsive autonomous manufacturing operations at a competitive cost. My reseach mainly focus on developing advanced machine learning methods and stochastic models to ensure the quality and reliability of products in smart manufacturing, especially for **additive manufacturing**. In terms of methodologies, I am interested in **Adversarial robustness**, **Bayesian optimization**, **Federated learning**, **Physics-informed machine learning**, **Reinforcement learning**, and **Tensor data analytics**, etc.
